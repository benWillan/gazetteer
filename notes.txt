1. Create an array of all the country names in countryBorders.geo.json.			(DONE)
2. Create an <input> and and <datalist> which display all the countries.		(DONE)
3. Get country ISO code device is in.											(DONE)
4. Use ISO code to get border lat/lng co-ords from JSON file.					(DONE)
6. Determine how many polygon arrays are in the country JSON.					(DONE)
7. Load correct polygon based on initial location on loading.					(DONE)
8. Clear previous polygon when a new one is loaded.								(NOT DONE)

x. Prevent the drop-down box from appearing until after something is typed in.	(NOT DONE)
x. Change the direction of the drop-down box.									(NOT DONE)
x. Change the number of options displayed in the drop-down box.					(NOT DONE)

Program Flow
============

- App starts and script runs Navigator.
- Navigator gets lng/lat co-ords.
- AJAX request sent to getCountryInfo.php to get country ISO2 based on lng/lat.
- getCountryInfo makes a cURL request to geonames API that returns the JSON object for the long/lat co-ords.
- Another AJAX request is then chained inside the first which requests the countryBorders arrays from the country with the same ISO2 code.


Questions
=========

- Where did the countryBorders.geo.json data come from?
- Why does index.html default as the file be run.
- Why does a php file still output when the header() is not included/ commented out?
- Should the ajax requests return anything?

geo.json
========

//countryJSON['geometry']['coordinates'] 				- the total nested arrays [ [ [...]]].
//countryJSON['geometry']['coordinates'][0] 			- the array containing the array of first set of arrays of lat/lng array pairs.
//countryJSON['geometry']['coordinates'][0][0] 			- the first of the nested arrays. containing the first set of array lat/lng pairs.
//countryJSON['geometry']['coordinates'][0][0][0] 		- the first array of lat/lng pairs.
//countryJSON['geometry']['coordinates'][0][0][0][0] 	- the first lat/lng value in the array.
