Program Flow
============

- App starts and script runs Navigator.
- Navigator gets lng/lat co-ords.
- AJAX request sent to getCountryInfo.php to get country ISO2 based on lng/lat.
- getCountryInfo makes a cURL request to geonames API that returns the JSON object for the long/lat co-ords.
- Another AJAX request is then chained inside the first which requests the countryBorders arrays from the country with the same ISO2 code.


Questions
=========

- Where did the countryBorders.geo.json data come from?
- Why does index.html default as the file be run.
- Why does a php file still output when the header() is not included/ commented out?
- Should the ajax requests return anything?
